// if we use multiple variables inside the argument then the execution of the function will be not efficient as it consume the 
// more space . so we can use the object inside the argument as below;
const multiple=({a,b,c,d,e})=>{
console.log(a,b,c,d,e);

}
multiple({a:10,b:20,c:30,d:40,e:50})

// when there is multiple argument to pass through then we can use this concept 
// as when the frontend gives many data for the backend then we can use this concept
