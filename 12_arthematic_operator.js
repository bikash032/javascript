// operation is the giving the mathmatical, logical ,relational instruction for the operands to perform its funtion. 
// types of operation in java script 
// 1. arthematic operation==> which uses +,-,/,*,%
// 2. logical operation ==>
                        //AND && ==> if both condition is true then it gives true , one condition is false thn gives false 
                        //OR || ==> at least one condition is true then give true 
                        // NOT ! ==> if true then makes false and if false then makes true 
// 3. INCREASEMENT AND DECREASEMENT OPERATORS===>
                  //a++ ==> first print the value and after it will increase by 1  post assaign 
                  //++a ==> pre assaign 
                  //a-- ==> post assaign
                  //--a ==> pre assaign
 let a = 100;
 let b =200;
 a=b++;
 console.log(a); // 200 because it print the value of b which is 200
 console.log(b); // 201 because itself the value of b within there will be executed by operating all so b will be there 201  
        
 //4. assaignment operator ==> +=,-=,*=,/=,<=,>=.......
